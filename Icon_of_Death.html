Welcome to <b>Icon of Death</b>, a solo adventure for the Dragon Warriors system. To play this adventure, first create your own character or Rank 3 or 4, perhaps one you used in a previous Red Ruin adventure. You may play any Profession.</p>
<p>You’ll need dice and a character sheet. You could photocopy the sheet in the Dragon Warriors Rules. Alternatively, follow the link below to download. Stop awhile whilst you’re there.</p>

</div>
<p>In the adventure, text in <b>bold</b> indicates an item that you can take and add to your inventory. Text in <i>italics</i> indicates a code word that you should note down.</p>
<p>If a fight is presented you will see options for <span class='check'>&nbsp;win&nbsp;</span>, <span class='check'>&nbsp;lose&nbsp;</span>, and <span class='check'>&nbsp;flee&nbsp;</span> — choose the one most relevant for the result of your fight.</p>
<p>Where it is possible to use a skill or spell to affect the outcome of a section, the text will give you an option to use it. Combat spells should just be used in combat as normal.
<h3>Food, Water, and the desert</h3></p>
<p>Icon of Death is set in the burning hot deserts of Legend; food, water, and heat are all of deadly importance.</p>
<p><b>Rations:</b> You may be instructed to <span class='check'>&nbsp;eat a ration&nbsp;</span>, which means to take a meal. When creating your character, each ration costs 1 florin and takes up one inventory slot.</p>
<p><b>Water:</b> You may be instructed to <span class='check'>&nbsp;drink water&nbsp;</span>, which requires you to have a filled waterskin in your inventory. When you drink water, you empty the waterskin. When creating your character, each water skin costs 1 florin and takes up one inventory slot.</p>
<p><b>Heat:</b> The heat of the desert day is overwhelming, and can be especially exhausting for anyone not properly dressed. Armour, in particular, can be a problem. All armour worn in the desert is treated as having -1 AF, to represent how it must be stripped down against the heat. This has already been taken into account in the stats of monsters you may face in combat.</p>

                        <i>The year is 993AS. Prince Adymas of Lavasse's "Poor Crusade" has broken down into a series of desperate rearguard battles across the lands of Outremer — the Principalities of the Crusade — without ever reaching Ibrahim, the holy city. All across the land, people fear that Adymas will soon be forced all the way back to the sea at Crescentium. If he cannot seize some advantage, the Principalities could be lost.</i>
<i>Brave knights and soldiers have flocked to the Principalities to lend the Prince their aid, but you have your own reasons for counting yourself as an ally of Adymas, which bring you too to Crescentium ...</i>
<p>A bright and relentless sun beats down on the streets of Crescentium — the crusader city that lies at the very west of Outremer — but Coros Vallin has pulled closed the fretwork shutters that cover the windows of his private sanctum so that you meet him in the shadows.</p>
<p>Marshal Vallin does not rise from his chair as you enter, he is old now, no longer the mighty knight who once fought at the forefront of the crusader armies, and led the assault against the walls of Ibrahim; but you know that he is still the Prince's most trusted advisor. The fact that he has called you here, shows that he trusts you in turn.</p>
<p>He cuts at once to the chase.</p>
<p>"You must know that Prince Adymas is in dire straits, but perhaps not how dire. If aid is not brought to him soon, he will certainly lose the Principality of Sadar, and possibly everything east of Cabbron."</p>
<p>Vallin reaches below his desk and produces a small package, wrapped tightly in layers of linen, and fastened with twine.</p>
<p>"But I have here something that could turn that tide." He taps the package with a finger. "It may not look like much, but believe me when I tell you that it <i>must</i> reach him."</p>
<p>That, it seems, is where you come in.</p>
<p>Vallin explains that they cannot risk sending this package openly. Unknown hostile forces will do anything to get their hands on it. Instead, you must find a way to cross the blistering and hostile desert between Crescentium and Sadar, and place the package into Prince Adymas's hands.</p>
<p>"There is a caravan leaving soon, you might travel with that," Vallin says. "Alternatively, a Capellar knight named Balthazar has been staying here and is leaving for the front, you could ride with him. Or maybe you would prefer to travel alone. I will not tell you the best path, in fact, I think it would be best if I did not know how you travelled, our enemies have ... ways, to learn what we know."</p>
<p>Vallin slides a pack across the table. It contains <b>150 florins</b>, a filled <b>waterskin</b>, five <b>rations</b>, a <b>healing salve</b> (restores 3HP), and a <b>letter of identity</b>. He also hands you the <b>mysterious package</b> (note this as <b>mysterious package (50)</b> on your inventory).</p>
<div class='rules'>You may choose to examine the package at any time when you are alone. To do so <a href='#50'>turn to 50</a>, first making a note of your current passage, so that you can return to it.</div>
<p>"I would wish you good luck, but I think you will need more than luck," Vallin says. "At all costs, you must be on the road by tomorrow. The Prince is waiting. Be safe."</p>
<p>Your interview is over, it is time to prepare.</p>
<p>You leave Coros Vallin's sanctum and head out into the official compound that surrounds it, a bastille adjacent to the Capellar Temple of the Roc. You are Coros' guest here. You have a chamber, where you can rest, a place at the refectory table, and a stall in the stables where your <b>palfrey</b> Bayard awaits you.</p>
<div class='rules'>You do not need to record Bayard as an item, and he has his own inventory of 10 items. When you take an item, make a note of whether it is in your inventory or Bayard's. You can swap items any time you are in the same location as Bayard, unless told otherwise.</div>
<p>As you cross the courtyard you overhear two soldiers talking to each other in hushed terms. One says, "They say the Caliph has sent demons against the Prince! I have heard talk of winged men who descend on his troops with javelins of lightning."</p>
<p>The other replies, "I don't know if I believe <i>that</i>, but there is sorcery at work there, that's for sure. If some help cannot be had for him soon, I fear the Prince will be forced to retreat!"</p>
<p>Time is of the essence, and you must arrange for your journey, so you <a href='#136'>head into the city (turn to 136)</a></p>

                        <p>With three members missing in the space of as many days, the caravaneers band together for protection, wanting nothing to do with the strangers travelling alongside them. This does not appear to be a barrier to Mehmet, who is everywhere amongst them, talking first to one man, then another.</p>
<p>Setting yourself to discover what he is doing is no easy task. You do not have the easy familiarity with the Badawin and Molasarians that Mehmet has.</p>

                        <p>The interior of the Sacra Familia is dominated by its soaring dome, a magnificent spectacle of gold and lapis inlaid with sacred figures. You recognise the beatific countenance of Gatanades, the Saviour, and also of Akaabah the Illuminate of Ta'ashim, bearing his pen and tablet. The two prophets face each other across the dome.</p>
<p>A throng of the faithful circle the temple sunwise, passing from station to station, making offerings, receiving anointments of oil, and raising their voices in prayer, so that the whole space reverberates with a susurrus of noise. Overhead, pigeons soar.</p>
<p>Pushing your way through the crowds, you spy the High Priest Barbatos at the head of a group of lesser clerics, making offerings at an altar. He looks the same as when last you met him, on the sea crossing from Ferromaine — tall, old, and spry, like a spriggan in a man's form. You can <a href='#180'>attempt to speak to him (turn to 180)</a>, or think better of your temerity and <a href='#136'>return to the heart of the city (marking a box) (turn to 136)</a>.</p>

                        <p>As your magic takes hold, Monaciello's demeanour changes. The boy laughs good-naturedly and, to your surprise, the ghostly glow fades away, leaving him apparently solid.</p>
<p>"Oh amico mia! How good to see you. What a fine joke I have been playing on this woman. Her Great-Grandmother, she was also my good friend, and so I gave her a gift, but this <i>stupida</i> woman sold it, so I was angry."</p>
<p>"A joke!" Donna Viltry gasps. "My brother is vanished, my ship is sunk, men are missing, and you call this a joke?"</p>
<p>"I do not do these things!" Monaciello protests. "It is bad enough I must come to this horrible country where everything is so hot. Now I think I will go home, but first I give my good friend a gift, because I think you will need it!"</p>
<p>Monaciello gives you a blessing of <b>good luck</b> (this does not use an inventory slot). Once, you may use the blessing to re-roll any one dice; the blessing is then spent. After that, he vanishes, as if he had never been there! <a href='#58'>turn to 58</a>.</p>

                        <p>Abu Wasr leads you to the highest point of the brass city, a domed tower whose high roof is supported by a ring of soaring arches that give views in every direction. From here you look out on the inverted bowl of the night sky, which glitters above the observatory in all its glory. On the inside of the dome, a mirror of these constellations is picked out in silver inlay.</p>
<p>Abu Wasr points at one of the stars, a flickering red point above the northern mountains. "There is Qalb al-Asad, the heart of the lion, a star most beloved of our Queen."</p>
<p>You look down and see that the whole sweep of Outremer is also visible from the tower. You can see the lights of Crescentium by the sea to the west, and the river mouths of Sadar at the east. Abu Wasr notices you looking.</p>
<p>"Ahh yes, is the view from here not fine."</p>
<p>If you wish, you can sketch a <b>map of the principalities</b> here.</p>
<p>Once you are done, Abu Wasr enquires whether you wish to proceed to the <a href='#285'>aviary (turn to 285)</a>, the <a href='#95'>throne room (turn to 95)</a>, or return to the <a href='#299'>entrance (turn to 299)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You recognise the tiny instrument as an <b>Aeolian Harp</b>, a tool used by the Elementalist magicians of the northern lands to cast their spells.

                        <p>You fear that the raiders might infiltrate the camp under the cover of their frontal attack, and your intuition proves to be correct.

<p>When the sun rises, you are surprised to hear the sound of nearby voices, whinnying horses, and bustle. Peering cautiously over the edge of the prominence the ruin stands on, you see that a caravan has arrived and set camp at the foot of the cliffs — the very same caravan that Coros Vallin suggested you might take from Crescentium. It's clear that the ruin marks a waypoint for them.</p>

<p>Once he is out of sight of the caravan, Iskander stops in the shadow of a tree and kneels on the ground. It is an odd place to pray, and it becomes even odder when you see him place a series of objects on the ground and make obeisance to them. It is no True Faith ritual, nor a Ta'ashim one.</p>

<p>The caravan settles down to a troubled and uneasy night under the cold and uncaring stars, disturbed by dreams. You also dream, but your dream is not a nightmare.</p>
<p>In your dream, you are lying on a soft divan in a pleasant court. Water trickles from a blue-tiled fountain and the sound of birdsong tickles your ears. You open your eyes to see a figure seated on a throne, but the dappled light reflecting from the pool obscures its features; you have an impression of gold and ivory.</p>
<p>"You walk a perilous road, all unknowing," the figure says, and its voice is like the music of the lyres they play in Crescentium. "But know this, the Winged King <i>fears</i> that which you carry, for it can be used to command his service, if you have the secret of using it. It is for this reason that he has his minions hunt you, while seeking to steal it for himself by hiding amongst you."</p>
<p>"This, I am permitted to tell you. If you are forced to confront him, anoint the idol with your own blood, and make of him one demand."</p>
<p>You wake refreshed as if you had truly rested in the pleasant court.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am following you, and why wouldn't I. What is your purpose in speaking to so many in the caravan? There's a killer on the loose, a monster hiding amongst us. Is it you?"</p>
<p>Mehmet gasps and sheathes the dagger he was hiding. "You think <i>I</i> am the killer? I deny it. I thought it might be you. These caravaneers are my people, followers of the word of the Illuminate, just as I am. I fear for their safety. There are still days ahead of us, who know what will happen?

                        <p>You decide to dismount and try to find something, anything, to eat or drink amongst the dead trees. You are parched, but it is Bayard that concerns you most; you aren't sure how much further the brave horse can go.</p>
<p>You wander amongst the trees. Few of the desiccated trunks are more than a few feet high, but one tree catches your eye because it still bears a few pale and leafless branches. Water seeps from under its gnarled roots, forming a tiny dirty pool in the shadow of some rocks, with a few thorny shrubs for Bayard to graze on.</p>
<p>When you approach the water, you are warned off by the hiss of a serpent. You can see it, coiled and ready to strike in the shadow of the roots. There is no way to reach the water without dealing with it!</p>
<p>If you wish to <a href='#66'>strike at the snake (turn to 66)</a>, if you'd rather try and <a href='#128'>dodge past it (turn to 128)</a>. If you prefer to abandon the effort you can <a href='#230'>ride on east (turn to 230)</a>.</p>

                        <p>The sun rises on another day of punishing heat. Every exposed inch of your flesh is wind-burnt and raw. You go to mount up, but Bayard hangs his head and baulks. It's clear that he feels the heat even worse than you. In the desolation of the Alqafr, there is little to eat and nothing to drink, and a horse's needs are far greater than yours. You've got this far on sheer stubbornness, but now the poor beast is done.</p>

                        <p>Using the cover of the battle, you slip away to root through the possessions of the other travellers — any one of whom could have been responsible for Usquail's disappearance. There's only time to examine the belongings of one person, will it be <a href='#225'>Sir Boise (turn to 225)</a>, <a href='#251'>Donna Viltry (turn to 251)</a>, <a href='#197'>Iskander (turn to 197)</a>, <a href='#88'>Mehmet (turn to 88)</a>, or <a href='#300'>Martense (turn to 300)</a>?</p>

                        <p>The final stretch of the journey goes qickly, and your destination is soon in view. Sadar is a small walled city, with high copper rooftops glittering above whitewashed walls. A broad stone bridge arches from it, crossing the river towards Ibrahim. Normally the city is surrounded by dusty fields and orange groves, instead, you ride past the tented ranks of Prince Adymas's army. On the other side of the river, you can just make out the Caliph's matching bivouac.</p>
<p>The caravan trails back before the gate — it will take hours for the soldiers to search it — but you and Boise ride ahead. True to his word, Boise makes sure that you pass through the gate without issue. Inside, the narrow streets are packed with soldiers and refugees from the fighting across the river. Badawins and crusaders rub shoulders under the striped awnings that spread from building to building.</p>
<p>You ask at the gate where Prince Adymas is to be found, and are directed towards a large building crowned with a singular tower overlooking the river, from which, you are told, the Prince plans his strategies. You expect Boise to leave you now, but he takes the same road.</p>
<p>"Hold hard," you say to him, reining Bayard in, "what is <i>your</i> business with the Prince?"</p>
<p>Boise gives you a curious look, then says, "I'll tell you truthfully then. I am a messenger, sent to the Prince by Marshall Vallin with an item of the utmost importance."</p>
<p>You give a start, unable to hide the surprise on your face. "But that's my errand! How can it also be yours."</p>
<p>"Hah! Coros Vallin was ever cunning! Who knows how many messengers he sent, and which of us has the real package. Let us go up and see?"</p>
<p>You continue to the palace, where a grim-faced sentry asks for proof of your mission. If you have the <b>letter of identity</b> Coros Vallin gave you, <a href='#241'>turn to 241</a>, otherwise <a href='#148'>turn to 148</a>.</p>

                        <p>You have no water to spare for your horse. Instead, you mount him and force him onwards into the teeth of the ceaseless wind. Your cruelty achieves nothing. You have not gone far before Bayard collapses, tumbling you into the dirt. You tug on his reins, but the poor beast has succumbed to the desert.</p>
<p>You have no choice but to continue on foot, and that too is a pointless effort. Without Bayard to carry your camping gear, and to keep you clear of the dust and the venomous creatures it contains, you cannot make it out of the Alquafr alone. Soon, the sand hides both your corpses as if you had never existed.</p>

                        <p>"I'm innocent!" you shout, gripping the wooden bars set into the door of your makeshift prison.</p>
<p>"Save it for Mistress Farah," Owais chuckles, "or for the noose!"</p>
<p>The interior of the hut is a single room with stone walls and a flat roof. The door is flimsy enough, you could probably bash it open, but a quick peek through the bars shows you that one of the caravan guards has been stationed outside. At least it's cool in here. You slump down on the beaten earth of the floor to consider your fate. Someone killed Iskander, who? He was at the back of Boise's tent. Was it Boise? or is that too obvious?</p>
<p>The day slides past. You watch the barred sunlight edge across the floor from right to left. You begin to feel hungry, and thirsty, but no one comes to bring you food, and eventually, you start to doze.</p>
<p>You are awoken by the sound of a stifled clatter from outside. The patch of sunlight has been replaced by moonlight. You creep to the door and make out a figure going through your belongings — it's Owais. Even as you look, he gasps in delight and lifts up Coros Vallin's package.</p>
<p>"I have it!" he whispers to someone else you cannot make out.</p>
<p>"Hand it over." It is Boise's voice.</p>
<p>Owais again: "You promised me riches!"</p>
<p>"And you shall have them."</p>
<p>Owais steps out of view, so you only hear what happens next. A few muffled words; a sudden gasp, like air released from a bladder; the steel hiss of a knife; the thump of a body being lowered to the ground. Then, the jingle of steel and the sudden hoofbeats of a horse!</p>
<p>Sir Boise has stolen the package! If you wish to pursue you must smash the door open — make a  <span class='check'>&nbsp;1d20 roll under your STRENGTH&nbsp;</span> and lose 1 Health Point. If you fail the roll (or choose not to make it, or cannot do so because you only have 1 HP), you will simply have to <a href='#239'>wait for release (turn to 239)</a>, otherwise <a href='#288'>turn to 288</a>.</p>

                        <p>It is a long hard ride, using all your guile to avoid the flying watchers who are searching for you. Eventually, the blue-grey smudge ahead resolves into a line of cliffs, crowned with what looks like a singular tower, balanced on the edge.</p>
<p>With no other destination in sight, you head for the tower, only to discover a caravan from Crescentium encamped at the base of the cliffs. You are exhausted, hunted, and low on supplies, the only sensible decision seems to be <a href='#77'>join the caravan (turn to 77)</a>, where your pursuers will not find you.</p>

                        <p>The next day, the caravan sets out on the final leg of its journey to Sadar. The teamsters rise early, jockeying the obstinate camels into their familiar formations, but the whole enterprise is muted and without joy, after the murder and exile of the previous day. After a quick and uncomfortable breakfast, each of the remaining travellers makes sure to place themselves where they will not be disturbed by conversation.</p>
<p>The only exception is Sir Boise, who makes a point of drawing his stallion up beside you as the oasis falls behind.</p>
<p>"That was a hard thing you were forced to do yesterday," the usually taciturn knight says. "I admire you for it."</p>
<p>He sets his eyes on the road ahead. "We do not need to linger, we could reach the city faster than the caravan, now that we are on a safe road. You will have no trouble getting through the gates with a Capellar knight at your side."</p>
<p>You demure. "I'd rather see the journey out with the others. I feel I owe them as much."</p>
<p>Boise nods. "Well said, well said."</p>

                        <p>You realise that King Pazuzu and his followers must have been the figures depicted on the rock carving you saw in the south — and surely also the winged figures hunting you! After a moment of deliberation, you decide to ask Abu Wasr about the <b>golden icon</b>, describing it circumspectly as a tale you once heard told in the taverns of Crescentium.</p>
<p>The djinn nods his heavy head and strokes his beard. "Ahh, the Icon of Death, that is our name for it. You are correct, it too was part of the Creator's curse, that not only should the king be diminished and sent into the wastes, but at the same time an golden image should come into being that had the power to command the king, as he had once commanded thousands."</p>
<p>Abu Wasr stares off into the distance. "Naturally, King Pazuzu hates that icon with all his heart, and fears it in equal measure I should imagine. Many times he has tried to destroy it, But it is the will of God that it is always found, and that he is forced to serve."</p>
<p>The djinn seems to abruptly remember that he is meant to be giving you a tour, and asks if you wish to continue to the <a href='#285'>aviary (turn to 285)</a>, <a href='#5'>observatory (turn to 5)</a>, or return to the <a href='#299'>entrance (turn to 299)</a>?</p>

<p>"Oh! Forgive me, I am in such a state!"</p>
<p>"What is the matter? Please, tell me."</p>
<p>She wails, "I am cursed. I have cursed us!"</p>
<p>You manage to calm her down and get her to explain. She tells you a sorry tale. </p>
<p>"You see, I am known as a rich merchant, but the truth is that I had to beg borrow and steal to obtain my capital. In my family, there was a treasure handed down through the generations, a golden statue of a boy. We called him Monaciello because he was dressed like a novice.</p>
<p>"Well, it was said that as long as Monaciello was held by the family, we would have good fortune. That's what my ancestors believed, but there had been no good luck in our family for a long time, only the dwindling of our inheritance. So I foolishly sold the boy to raise the money for this grand expedition that I thought would restore all our fortunes.</p>
<p>"Since that day, I have been cursed. My brother vanished on crusade to Ibrahim. One of the two ships I bought in Ferromaine foundered and sank. And now these dissapearing men, it is the same curse, I am sure. Now, today, I have seen Monaciello here, in the desert, and I know he is <i>molto</i> angry. I will be ruined, no matter what I do!"</p>
<p>"Here? Where?" You look around, expecting a glimpse of this spirit, but there is nothing to be seen.</p>

                        <p>A search is quickly organised by the caravaneers to look for the missing Usquail, in the hope that he has just wandered away from the camp and become lost.

<p>There is little to see until you come to the back of the tower, furthest from the entrance, only to be greeted by an unwelcome surprise. A body lies face down in the sand against the ruined wall at the back of the tower. The burnt and desiccated skin makes it clear that it has lain in the sun for at least a week.</p>
<p>You cautiously turn the body over — and jerk back in horror as you realise that the man's heart has been torn from his chest. When you recover your choler you take a second look at the body. It is a young northern man, but you do not recognise his face. He has been stripped of most of his possessions but is dressed in the sort of padded jack worn by knights and soldiers, though given his apparent youth, he must have been a squire or a new recruit.</p>
<p>You puzzle over how this body came to be hidden here, but the dead man has no answers, save one — embroidered on the right shoulder of his jack is a symbol like three ships surrounded by a circle. You don't recognise it, but assume it is the coat of arms of the knight he served or the unit he was a member of.</p>

<p>You decide to call the pilgrim's bluff.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am following you, and why wouldn't I. What is your purpose in speaking to so many in the caravan? There's a killer on the loose, a monster hiding amongst us. Is it you?"</p>
<p>Mehmet gasps and sheathes the dagger he was hiding. "You think <i>I</i> am the killer? I deny it. I thought it might be you. These caravaneers are my people, followers of the word of the Illuminate, just as I am. I fear for their safety, that is all."</p>
<p>"Then why do you carry letters written in Zhenir? Is this the action of a simple pilgrim?"</p>
<p>Mehmet grimaces. "Ahh, you have robbed me as well as spied on me. You are a cunning devil, but I will tell you what you must have already guessed. I am not simply a pilgrim, but an agent of the Caliph, just as I suspect that you are an agent of the Prince. But that does not mean I am a killer, especially of fellow Ta'ashim. Whatever evil is at work here, it is none of my doing, and I am willing to swear on the Illuminate that this is so."</p>
<p>You know that this is not an oath sworn lightly. Maybe Mehmet is not the culprit after all? <a href='#118'>turn to 118</a> (marking a box).</p>

                        <p>You turn and run, hoping to leap into Bayard's saddle and escape the djinn, but it easily overtakes you.</p>
<p>"Base worm! Now you compound your trespass with definace! So be it, let this be a lesson to you!"</p>
<p>The djinn snatches you up in his whirling cloud and speeds you across the open desert, flinging you this way and that. You suffer 1d4 HP of damage. If this reduces you to 0HP <a href='#28'>turn to 28</a> now. </p>
<p>Otherwise, you find yourself flung to the ground in some trackless spot, with poor unfortunate Bayard and all your belongings scattered nearby. You slowly pick yourself up and remount. It's unclear where you are, so without a better plan, you head south, hoping to pick up the edge of the escarpment. <a href='#266'>Turn to 266</a>.</p>

                        <p>You quickly saddle Bayard and set off up the trail to the ruin at top of the cliffs. It's hard going, and you have to keep a tight hold of the reins, but eventually, you reach the top, where you are rewarded by a vertiginous view over the valley below. The caravan looks like a colony of ants.</p>
<p>You turn your attention to the ruin. It appears to be some sort of ancient watchtower, fashioned from huge blocks of sandstone. Square windows open onto an empty space without floors. A low wall, half tumbled and buried in sand, surrounds the place. On the other side, a steep rocky plain spreads out to the north and east.</p>
<p>You can <a href='#154'>glance inside (turn to 154)</a>, <a href='#275'>search around the outside (turn to 275)</a>, or <a href='#93'>head back to the caravan now (turn to 93)</a>.

                        <p>You nervously climb the stairs that rise from the platform and enter a wondrous palace, with floors of marble and walls of burnished copper. Bright decorative tiles edge the walls, alongside filigrees of brass, gently swinging lanterns, and bright sprays of feathers and gold. Gracefully arched doorways lead from the entrance chamber into adjoining rooms.</p>
<p>There is a burst of smokeless fire, and suddenly an enormous fat man is floating beside you in the chamber. He is dressed in bright purple silks, hareem trousers, and a white turban crowned with a peacock feather. He is quite clearly a djinn.</p>
<p>"Visitor!" the djinn booms, "I am the magnificent Abu Wasr, and since it seems you are in posession of a token of our Queen's regard, I will be pleased to show you around our sublime flying city."</p>
<p>You bow nervously, unsure how to reply.</p>
<p>"Now," he continues, "would you like to begin in the <a href='#95'>throne room (turn to 95)</a>, the <a href='#5'>observatory (turn to 5)</a>, or perhaps the <a href='#285'>aviary (turn to 285)</a>?"</p>

                        <p>"My heart is heavy," Mistress Farah tells you. "Even though the killer has been caught, the weight of this crime is still on us."</p>
<p>You can only agree. Even though the traitor in the caravan has been banished, the threat of attack on you has surely only faded a little. You will not rest easy until you reach Sadar.</p>
<p>Farah refills your cup of hibiscus tea from the pot that sits on a small table between you. The two of you sit in her tent, shielded from the oasis heat by a fitfully waving curtain of white cloth. "First we must hold a funeral for Iskander," Farah says. "I am not of his faith,  perhaps I can leave that to you?"</p>

<p>"It's true, I am a friend of Marshal Vallin, but I swear on my oath, what I know about the Prince's plans are no more than you might hear on the street. I carry certian messages for him, yes, but I will not know if he is about to advance, or retreat, until I reach Sadar, and then you will know the same thing."</p>
<p>Donna Viltry gasps in satisfaction and plies you with tea and questions about the Prince. Sir Boise, meanwhile, watches you with hooded eyes, his expression unreadable.</p>
<p>When you finally rise and bid them goodnight, Mehmet catches you by the arm and whispers in your ear: "That was ill done." You shake him off and head for your blankets, <a href='#227'>passing Usquail as you go (turn to 227)</a>.</p>

At once, the golden light turns red, and the King hesitates, poised in the act of tearing at your throat with his teeth. You heave a sigh of relief, and then realise with a growing sense of horror that you are not in control of the King ... as the half-remembered dream told you, you can only make a single request.</p>
<p>The King knows it too and begins to laugh, a terrible roaring sound. "You don't know the words, do you? Hah! Well, make your demand, but know that afterwards, I will kill you for this affront!"</p>
<p>There's only one thing you can think to command to save your life: "Let me win."</p>
<p>The King howls, but bows his head, allowing you an open strike. You go to strike the fatal blow, but the King folds his tattered wings around himself and a scorching desert wind howls into existence, pushing you back and tearing the tent from its footings. Within the vortex, the King's body dissolves into whirling sand, but his voice still echoes out.</p>
<p>"Fool! You think you can best the Winged King of the Desert? It is not so! Your foolish Prince cannot use the icon to control me, if he is dead!"</p>
<p>The vortex howls its way into the sky and then speeds east towards Sadar.</p>
<p>Prince Adymar has but one chance, you must reach Sadar in time to stop the King from killing him. You leap into Bayard's saddle and <a href='#316'>gallop east (turn to 316)</a>.</p>

<p>You cannot resist looking. Quickly, you open the linen wrapping. Inside is a small flat sandalwood box with the image of a lion on its front. When you open the box, a golden light spills out, like the sun, or fire.</p>
<p>Nestled inside the box is a golden icon, a hand-sized statue of a winged lion-man. You are no expert, but surely this is the work of an ancient age. The sight of it fills you with a nameless dread, and yet, you are sure that within this object lies immense power.</p>

<p>You decide to watch Sir Boise more closely, for surely his actions are worthy of suspicion. He makes it easy, for he sets himself up as a figurehead for the caravan, riding at its head, often with Martense or a cluster of caravan guards — always the same ones — at his side. One, named Owais, seems especially respectful to him.</p>
<p>Learning more about what he is <i>doing</i> is a harder task. He seems keen to be always in the public eye. Eventually, however, Farah calls a rest stop, and Boise has his chest of possessions brought out so that he can change his sweat-drenched tunic for a lighter garment. As he strips off the tunic, baring his well-muscled torso, you notice a mark embroidered on the fresh garment he produces, resembling three fish enclosed in a circle.</p>

<p>"None of them! The Winged King! The Lion King! The one who sees all and knows all! We serve him, and whoever serves him best will be elevated! And I, I shall be lauded in paradise!"</p>

<p>The guards snort. "Then you'll just have to wait for him to pass by." One of the guards points up at a tall tower overlooking the river, where Prince Adymas has taken up residence, and jokes, "Might take a while though! Maybe he'll look down and see you there!"</p>
<p>You have no choice but to settle down until the guards decide to let you in. You pick a spot in the shade of a tree and sit down to wait.

<p>Whether you join them or stay in Sadar to await the conquering forces, the result is the same, your mission has failed.

                        <p>You hold in your palm an exquisite scarab, crafted from weighty gold inlaid with lapis, jade, and faience. There can be no doubt that this is an ancient talisman, dating from before the True Faith. The sideburned merchant tells you that it was found clutched in the hand of a knight washed up in the bay, though you have no way of telling if this is true.</p>

                        <p>Soon, the sun rises fully, and the coastal plains begin to bake under its light. The heat draws up a fog from the Sea of Lament, that hangs over the lowlands like a cobweb. The humidity is unpleasant, but the mist provides a little bit of relief from the sun, so you see the wisdom of Balthazar's choice.</p>
<p>You attempt some conversation with your new companion, but the Knight seems to have lapsed into some sort of uneasy funk, and your words are answered only by grunts and nods.</p>
<p>Around noon you spy a dark shape through the mist to the south. You can <a href='#279'>divert to investigate (turn to 279)</a>, or continue as Balthazar advises and <a href='#91'>ride east (turn to 91)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You lead Bayard towards the caravan, arriving as it prepares to depart. Bleating trains of camels laden with cargo flank a line of carts, while caravaneers from what seems like every part of the world hurry back and forth, tightening ropes, stowing blankets, and kicking sand over the remains of their fires.</p>
<p>You are shown to the Caravan Mistress, a short brusque Ta'ashim woman named Farah.</p>
<p>"It is not usual for one to join a caravan in the middle of the wasteland," she tells you, "but it is not our way to refuse hospitality to any man, especially one who has clearly suffered the dangers of the wilderness." She asks you for your name and marks it down in a ledger that she carries at her waist.</p>
<p>"There is another thing. Before you can join us, you must swear the caravan oath — to treat each other as family until our destination is reached. If the caravan is threatened, you will take up arms to defend it. If a fellow caravaneer is attacked, you will come to their aid. You will not commit a crime against a fellow, nor defame their honour without proof."</p>
<p>She gives you a serious look. "If you violate this oath, you will be cast out of the caravan into the desert."</p>
<p>You swear the oath, and Farah introduces you to the other travellers accompanying the caravan. In addition to yourself, these are: a gruff Capellar Knight named Boise; Iskander, a blonde-haired priest from Mercania; Mehmet, a Ta'ashim pilgrim seeking the road to Ibrahim; Donna Viltry, a Ferromaine merchant whose cargo makes up most of the caravan; and finally Martense, a poorly-shaven man at arms, sweating in a suit of mail. <a href='#87'>Turn to 87</a></p>

                        <p>Mehmet pulls you urgently aside.</p>
<p>"My friend, this is now a curse from the creator. None of us wishes to make an accusation lightly, so I can only say that I will pray to the Illuminate, blessed be his name, that your eye is keen and your judgement sound. You have gathered all the evidence, make it count."</p>

                        <p>You pronounce your prayers, making the signs of your faith as you command the creature to leave. Monaciello throws up his spectral hands and exclaims, "This is no fun! Have mercy!"</p>
<p>"Fun? You call it fun to torment this woman so with your curses, you are a foul beast!"</p>
<p>"Mardre di Dio! All I do is a little trick. There is no curse. You are very rude to me, so I leave."</p>
<p>Donna Viltry, surprised by these words, calls out for the spirit to explain itself, but the power of your prayers has banished it, and it will trouble her no more. <a href='#58'>Turn to 58</a>.</p>

                        <p>The ruins prove to be little more than the shell of some ancient watchtower, half-buried in sand, but you don't take time to look around. You leap from Bayard's saddle and drag him, bucking and whinnying, into the dubious cover of the tower's lower floor. You wedge yourself into a narrow space, where a slab of stone leans against the tower walls — keeping Bayard as close as you can with taught reins.</p>
<p>An angry roar splits the air as the creatures arrive. Flapping shadows wheel around the outside of the ruin, blocking the light. Bayard rears, and it's all you can do to cling to his bridle and keep him from bolting. </p>
<p>"Quiet boy, quiet good Bayard," you murmur, trying your best to calm him.</p>
<p>You expect the creatures to land and corner you in the ruin, but nothing appears at the bright entranceway. Eventually, the shadows vanish and the sound ceases. It sounds like they have left.</p>
<p>You can <a href='#19'>venture out to explore the tower (turn to 19)</a>, or <a href='#53'>stay under cover (turn to 53)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You ride deep into the shadows of the canyons, one eye constantly on the sky, but it appears that the winged figures are unwilling to follow you into the labyrinth. What were they? You can't say for sure — you were too busy fleeing to get a good look at them. They <i>might</i> have been a random danger of the desert, but you find that hard to believe.</p>
<p>The canyons are as baking hot as an oven, the rocks reflecting back the sun's heat tenfold. If you don't have a filled <b>waterskin</b> (or magical means of creating water), lose one Health Point (this doesn't empty the waterskin).</p>
<p>Bayard is exhausted after his gallop, hanging his head and panting for air. You dismount and lead him by the reins until his breathing has eased, and you have travelled some miles east. The shadows have grown long; the day is winding on.</p>
<p>Eventually, you see a ruined tower silhouetted against the deep blue sky above. This must be the same one you saw before you fled from the flying creatures. There seems to be no route to pass it by, so you cautiously lead Bayard up a winding slope until you <a href='#124'>arrive at the ruin (turn to 124)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You push past the guard and charge up the stairs, then burst through the door into the Prince's chamber. Chairs and tables are overturned in a chaos of scattered maps and smashed pottery. The Prince is on his back, with the Winged King standing over him like the shadow of death.</p>
<p>"You again!" the King snarls, "will you never cease to devil me!"</p>
<p>To your relief, you see that the Prince is not dead, though he is badly wounded. As you draw your weapons to face the King for a second time, Adymas rolls over and crawls away. With a quick thought, you pull the <b>golden icon</b> from your robe and throw it to the Prince.</p>
<p>"My Prince! Here!"</p>
<p>Adymas grabs the icon, and clutches it to his chest like a lifeline.</p>
<p>"Keep ... him ... busy ..."</p>
<p>The King roars in distress and tries to pounce on the Prince, but you put yourself in the way. You must <span class='check'>&nbsp;fight&nbsp;</span> him once more.</p>

<p>You arrive at the caravanserai just as the rising sun clears the distant horizon, to find the caravan already mustering to depart in the dusty field before the Iron Gates. Teamsters and packmen hurry back and forth, loading their camels with goods, or hitching them to the covered wagons that make up the core of the caravan.</p>
<p>You present yourself to caravan mistress Farah, who notes your arrival in her book and assigns a place for you and Bayard in the train.</p>
<p>Soon the Iron Gates are hauled open by the gate guards, letting the hot wind of the desert sweep in over the waiting train. The camels bleat and the horses snort, while the teamsters pull up the collars of their thobes.</p>
<p>Farah calls the caravan passengers together to explain the caravan's rules, and also to introduce you to each other. In addition to yourself, the travellers are: a gruff Capellar Knight named Boise; Iskander, a blonde-haired priest from  Mercania; Mehmet, a Ta'ashim pilgrim seeking the road to Ibrahim; Donna Viltry, a Ferromaine merchant whose cargo makes up most of the caravan; and finally Martense, a poorly-shaven man at arms, sweating in a suit of mail.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen and Ladies," Farah says, "when you join a caravan, you join a family, and so you must swear your oath to treat each other as family until our destination is reached.

<p>She gives you a serious look. "Whoever violates this oath will be cast out of the caravan into the desert."</p>
<p>You swear the oath, and Farah gives thanks to God and his Prophet, though you notice that she is canny enough not to specify <i>which</i> Prophet.</p>

The battle is still raging at the other side of the camp, but you want answers, and this man might be able to provide them. You haul off the hood with which the man has hidden his face, revealing the countenance of a wild-eyed Badawin tribesman. He has marked his cheeks with crude tattoos in the form of a lion's whiskers.

                        <p>As you lead Bayard to join the caravan, the Mercanian Priest, Iskander, comes up to greet you. He is pale-haired, and pale-skinned, with a bright band of sunburn across his cheeks, even though he has a shawl draped over his head.</p>
<p>"Forgive the others for not coming forward to greet you," he says. "The whole caravan is on edge, I don't mind telling you. Yesterday one of the caravaneers, a Ta'ashim named Usquail, vanished utterly. We spent an hour searching for him, the whole caravan, quartering the desert, but found nothing. It's as if something plucked him from the face of the earth!" You think of the winged figures that attacked you but keep your peace for now.</p>
<p>Iskander lowers his voice, though the chances that anyone is listening in are low. "If you ask me, someone here did something to him. I don't know who, but seeing as you alone were not part of the caravan, you are best placed to investigate. You should watch for anything suspicious."</p>

<p>There! To the left, you spy an outcropping of rocks, the only elevated ground for a league in any direction, you shouldn't wonder.

<p>One of the running figures pauses by the entrance to the tent and stammers: "The Prince is dead! A monster killed him! The Caliph is coming! Sadar is lost!"</p>
<p>You demand to be released, but the man abandons you to your fate, and you are still struggling with your bindings, unable to release yourself, when the Caliph's troops overrun the routing camp and take you prisoner.

<p>Abu Wasr drifts across the chamber like a billowing cloud of silk, brushing against the nodding heads of poppies and roses as he points out the features of the throne room.

                        <p>You duck through the doorway of the booth and see the fortune teller seated at a small table. Her face is hidden behind a veil of brightly coloured beads, hiding her features entirely.</p>
<p>"Cross my palm with ten silver, and I will foretell your future," the fortune-teller says.</p>
<p>You can demure, and <a href='#122'>leave the booth (turn to 122)</a>, or make the payment and take a seat, in which case, gain the keyword <i>Diorite</i> and read on.</p>
<p>"I see that you will soon leave the city." The fortune-teller seeks your future in the depths of a murky crystal that she keeps covered in a square of silk. </p>
<p>She continues: "Your road will be littered with death, no matter if you take the low road, or the high, with others or alone, but some routes are more dangerous than others. Choose your companions carefully. You will be hunted, for that which you carry will draw enemies as flies to honey."</p>
<p>You lean forward with increased interest, for this sounds to be more than the simple tricks of most would-be seers. In the dim light of the booth, you think you can see a hint of her face behind the veil, with wide dark eyes — hardly human at all. When she speaks again her tone is so different that it makes you start in surprise.</p>
<p>"Beware the giant who walks in human skin, for they are the lion of the desert. You will know them by their hatred of holy things. Be vigilant, for if you choose wrongly, the desert will claim your soul."</p>
<p>You fall back in shock, but the moment has passed. The seer hastily covers her crystal and tells you, in normal tones, that your interview is done. There is nothing for it but to <a href='#122'>return to the bazaar (turn to 122)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You hurry to be amongst the first to examine Usquail's belongings in the pale pre-dawn light. It's immediately clear to you that everything of value has been left behind.

<p>Beyond the gates, a dusty road leads east, flanked by a rough highland to the north, and a desolate scrubby plain to the south, where the shore of the Sea of Lament curves away into the mists beyond the uplands of Peras. At first, the morning is cool, and you can give Bayard his head, but as soon as the mist burns off the rising sun blazes down along the length of the road, transforming the air into a shimmer of fire.</p>

                        <p>You decide to eschew the company of your fellow travellers and ride with the teamsters and guards, a motley collection of Badawin drovers, Molasarian servants, and northerners recruited from the dregs of the crusade.</p>
<p>Although slightly wary of your company at first, the caravaneers soon relax into a practised mixture of work and gossip. You keep your ears open, and quickly come to realise that the caravaneers are on an edge that mistress Farah was at pains to conceal.</p>
<p>"I heard Usquail had a vision," one says, "of a burning lion. It can mean no good!"</p>
<p>Another says, "I have no fear of visions, may the Prophet bless us, but there were strange men in the caravanserai, asking questions. They had on thobes, but I thought they were Selentines in disguise."</p>
<p>"No no!" exclaims a third, "They were Zhenir spies, I am sure of it. This caravan must carry something of great value to the Caliph, for him to send agents to find it."</p>

You cast about, expecting to find Usquail somewhere nearby, perhaps unconscious, or hidden behind a bush, but there is nothing. You have never seen a trail vanish in this way.</p>

<p>If Iskander is correct, one of the other four travellers might be responsible for the death — for it is surely that — of Usquail. 'One of the other <i>five</i>' you correct yourself, Iskander cannot be assumed innocent. But how you should go about telling which, you cannot say.</p>
<p>Suddenly a yell from one of the sentries jerks you out of your reverie: "Beware! Bandits! Attack!"</p>

<p>It takes a little time to locate Balthazar, who is preparing for his own trip east. He seems a genial man, with a bushy beard and roughly shorn locks.

<p>"Coros Vallin told me you might be heading east also," Balthazar says when you introduce yourself. "I'd be glad of the company. The road is too well watched by raiders to be safe for a man alone, and the open desert is just as dangerous. Two travellers together are a lot safer than one."</p>

<p>You push aside the tent flap and duck inside into the gloom. A woman is seated on a large cushion, her face hidden behind a veil of brightly coloured beads, hiding her features entirely. You stop and look again. Surely this is the same woman who you paid to tell your fortune in Crescentium? But no, that's impossible!</p>
<p>"Take a seat," the seer says. "You are not the first foreigner to come and visit me here, and I sense that you want the same answers to the same questions."</p>
<p>"If those answers are true."</p>
<p>You have the impression that the woman smiles behind her veil, but you cannot be sure. "I always speak the truth."</p>
<p>"Tell me then."</p>
<p>The seer places a cup between you and pours liquid into it from a stoppered flask. "They say there is a creature that wanders the desert and preys on those that travel it, a devil that they call Pazuzu. This demon has the shape of a man with the head and paws of a lion, and the wings of an eagle."</p>
<p>A chill passes through you at this description.</p>
<p>"It is also said that the Pazuzu can disguise itself as a man, waiting to catch its victims alone before it plucks them up into the sky, never to be seen again. But even in this form there are certain signs that give it away. No matter what shape it takes, you may know it by its cruelty, its arrogance, and the fact that it will not touch any true relic, for these it cannot abide."</p>
<p>The veiled woman leans forward and adds: "They <i>also</i> say that this creature is a King to legion of fanatical followers, and that he who can command the King could command them all ... though who can say how this could be done."</p>
<p>You realise that Iskander must mean to try and force whoever he suspects to hold a relic. You also realize that he must be putting himself in terrible danger ... <a href='#184'>turn to 184</a>.</p>

                        <p>You dodge another swing of the King's claws and smear your own blood desperately on the icon. At once, the golden light turns red, and the King hesitates, poised in the act of tearing at your throat with his teeth. You heave a sigh of relief, and then realise with a growing sense of horror that you are not in control of the King ... as the half-remembered dream told you, you can only make a single request.</p>
<p>The King knows it too and begins to laugh, a terrible roaring sound. "You don't know the words, do you? Hah! Well, make your demand, but know that afterwards, I will kill you for this affront!"</p>
<p>There's only one thing you can think to command to save your life: "Let me win."</p>
<p>The King howls, but bows his head, allowing you an open strike. You go to strike the fatal blow, but the King folds his tattered wings around himself and a scorching desert wind howls into existence, pushing you back. Within the vortex, the King's body dissolves into whirling sand, but his voice still echoes out.</p>
<p>"Fool! You think you can best the Winged King of the Desert? It is not so! Your foolish Prince cannot use the icon to control me, if he is dead!"</p>
<p>The vortex howls its way into the sky and then speeds east towards Sadar.</p>
<p>Prince Adymar has but one chance, you must reach Sadar in time to stop the King from killing him. You leap into Bayard's saddle and <a href='#316'>gallop east (turn to 316)</a>.</p>

You smell water and hear the bleating of tethered camels. This is the oasis of El Uraj, where the water bubbles clean and pure from the ground. It marks the end of the Cabbron and the beginning of the principality of Sadar.</p>
<p>It appears that a badawin tribe has arrived before you, setting up an encampment of black tents from which the sound of reed pipes drifts. A few rough sandstone buildings, permanent parts of the oasis, stand nearby.</p>
<p>The caravaneers are overjoyed to arrive at El Uraj. They lead the camels to water, and then throw up their tents, breaking out the best of the stored food to eat in celebration. For tonight, at least, the strange events of the journey are forgotten, but you cannot forget.</p>

                        <p>As the first day in the Valley of Cabbron ends, the caravan sets camp by the side of the winding trail. Nothing marks this spot but the body of a horse rendered as dry as leather by the desert wind. Exhausted, you gratefully accept the offer of camel milk, bread, and cheese around the campfire.</p>
<div class='rules'>If you have lost any Health, you may regain 1 Health Point now.</div>
<p>Your meal is disturbed by the sound of raised voices. Two caravaneers are fighting. Knives have been drawn. You jump to your feet and push into the ring of onlookers that has gathered around them, just in time to hear one shout, "You! You son of a dog. You killed Kashif!"</p>
<i>Kashif ... one of the two who vanished after the battle.</i>
<p>"Ya gazma!" the other man swears. "<i>You</i> are the killer. You coveted Rida for yourself, <i>that</i> is why you killed Khasif!" He slashes at the first man with his jambiya, cutting a rent in his thobe that only just misses drawing blood.</p>

                        <p>The battle is over, and the remainder of the raiders driven off, but the celebrations prove to be shortlived.</p>
<p>As the caravaneers cautiously emerge from their hiding places, Iskander and Viltry call for water and cloth so that they can treat the wounded, setting up an impromptu hospital in the back of one of the wagons. Incredibly, none of the caravan crew are dead, though some of the camels have been slain, which you suspect might be worse for the caravan. Soon most of the caravan has gathered around their leader.</p>
<p>"God be praised!" Mistress Farah says, "Thanks to your aid, we have been delivered."</p>
<p>Mehmet makes the sign of the Prophet: "It is a miracle that none were killed."</p>
<p>It is at this very moment that one of the caravaneers runs up, aghast, and calls out to Farah, "Mistress! Rida and Kashif are missing!"</p>
<p>"Missing? Were they slain?"</p>
<p>"No, Mistress, they were hiding beside me, but now they are gone. It is like Usquail."</p>
<p>Joy turns at once to consternation as a quick investigation proves that the man was correct. Two more of the caravaneers have vanished in the aftermath of the battle, plucked from the face of the earth as if they had never existed — Rida, who had only just joined the caravan at Crescentium, and Kashif, one of the pack-handlers.</p>
<p>"What deviltry is this?" Martense exclaims. "How can two more of us be snatched away even as our battle is won? This expedition is cursed." </p>
<p>Sir Boise grunts, Donna Viltry concentrates on the wounded, Iskander makes to catch your eye.</p>
<p>Farah raises her hands for attention. "This sorrow will not lead us to our destination any faster, and we know that there is no point in searching for our comrades. We must move on." She raises her voice and yells, "Yalla, Yalla! Onwards. Mount up."</p>

                        <p>You strike the final blow, cutting Balthazar down. He collapses into the sand like a broken doll. One hand reaches out, groping blindly for the package, which has fallen from his sleeve, but you scoop it up.</p>
<p>"Why, Balthazar?"</p>
<p>The fallen knight's words emerge as a croak. "I had no choice. The King, the Winged King of the Desert. Once he has his claws in you ... beware ... he will ... not give up, till he has the icon ..."</p>
<p>You close the dead man's eyes and return to your camp to gather your belongings (you may recover your armour, and any items that were in Bayard's Inventory). You will have to <a href='#62'>continue alone (turn to 62)</a>.</p>

<p>"Fool!" Balthazar shouts, "Don't you understand what you <i>had</i>? The Winged King has sent all his servants to find it, but I'm the one, and now <i>I</i> can force the King to my will! I won't let you stop me!"</p>
<p>You exchange a few blows from horseback. His eyes are desperate, his hair dishevelled, his manner wild. After your blades clash, he calls out, "My King! Aid me!"</p>
<p>At once an amber glow gathers around him. He seems to grow larger. His shoulders hunch forward, and the glow forms a mane around his head. You must <span class='check'>&nbsp;fight&nbsp;</span> him, without the benefit of armour, though if you carry a shield you have that with you.</p>

                        <p>You dodge another swing of the King's claws and smear your own blood desperately on the icon. At once, the golden light turns red, and the King hesitates, poised in the act of tearing at your throat with his teeth. You heave a sigh of relief, and then realise with a growing sense of horror that you are not in control of the King ... as the half-remembered dream told you, you can only make a single request.</p>
<p>The King knows it too and begins to laugh, a terrible roaring sound. "You don't know the words, do you? Hah! Well, make your demand, but know that afterwards, I will kill you for this affront!"</p>
<p>There's only one thing you can think to command to save your life: "Let me win."</p>
<p>The King howls, but bows his head, allowing you an open strike. You go to strike the fatal blow, but the King folds his tattered wings around himself and a scorching desert wind howls into existence, pushing you and the caravaneers awat. Within the vortex, the King's body dissolves into whirling sand, but his voice still echoes out.</p>
<p>"Fool! You think you can best the Winged King of the Desert? It is not so! Your foolish Prince cannot use the icon to control me, if he is dead!"</p>
<p>The vortex howls its way into the sky and then speeds east towards Sadar.</p>

The King rends you open with his claws and takes Coros Vallin's package from your robes. He rips it open with a hook of his claws, revealing the golden icon within — a perfect miniature image of the King himself.</p>
<p>"At last, the icon is mine! Now I will be free of the Caliph, free of the Prince, free of anyone who seeks to control me, and let the Illuminate witness my oath, all of them shall perish for what they have done to me."</p>
<p>The King throws your body into the flames, and then, once more in Boise's from, staggers out of the tent to tell anyone who will listen that the killer, you, is dead.</p>

The King rends you open with his claws and takes Coros Vallin's package from your robes.

<p>"At last, the icon is mine! Now I will be free of the Caliph, free of the Prince, free of anyone who seeks to control me, and let the Illuminate witness my oath, all of them shall perish for what they have done to me."</p>
<p>The King casts your body into the crowd of cowering caravaneers, and then launches himself into the sky with one sweep of his mighty wings. All those left behind can do is make sure that your body is buried next to Iskanders.</p>

The soldiers stand aside, although not before favouring you with a glare, and you mount the lowest of the steps that lead up to the altar and wait with a bowed head.</p>
<p>"My friend!" Barbatos exclaims, descending the steps to embrace you, "it has been too long since the sea crossing! That was an adventure, was it not, but I think perhaps you have an even greater one in store. Let us speak."</p>
<p>Barbatos takes you aside and bids you walk beside him — it is common practice for those seeking privacy in the temple to stay in motion so that no one can overhear you for long.</p>
<p>"Coros Vellin told me that he planned to assign you to a mission. I do not know the details, and I don't <i>want</i> to know!" He throws up his hands to emphasise the point, "but I know it will be dangerous, and I have an idea that may help."</p>
<p>Barbatos leads you to a side chapel dedicated to Saint Patrus, patron of the long-suffering. There, he hauls on a chain, lifting the metal cover on a font set near the wall. He takes a glass vial and fills it with holy water from the font, then hands you the <b>healing waters</b> (heals 7HP, or 3HP if you drink half).</p>
<p>"Drink this when the shadow of death threatens to overwhelm you, and know that the Saint will watch over you."</p>

                        <p>The second day of travel is more subdued than the first — the pall of Usquail's disappearance still hangs over the caravan. The sun is especially fierce, battering the plain with waves of heat that set the air shimmering with phantom hills and illusionary water. Once, you think you see a golden palace hovering in the air, but there is nothing there.</p>
<p>The caravan pushes on till dusk, following the road into the inky shadows of the northern cliffs. Camp is finally set at a place where a ruined tower rises from a jutting prominence above, like the raised tail of a scorpion in the night. A guard is set, and the camels penned close to the fires. After a simple meal, you spread your blankets beside the fire, where each man sleeps in easy reach of the next.</p>
<div class='rules'>If you have lost any Health, you may regain 1 Health Point now.</div>

<p>Looking up, you see the ruined tower clear against the sky. A narrow path winds up the cliff towards it, though you can see that it would take some time to reach. You ask one of the caravaneers what it is.</p>
<p>The woman shrugs. "An old ruin, has always been there. No one visits."</p>
<p>"But I <i>could</i> visit? If I wanted."</p>

                        <p>You see Martense turn his horse away from the caravan and the road. It seems he is making no attempt to hide, but you follow him anyway. He reins his horse in by a little mound, where the wasteland dust has banked around a singular stone. There's no way to approach unseen, but you realise he was leading you here, and bring Bayard up beside him.</p>
<p>"It's a grave, you realise." Martense points at the mound. "A casualty of the battle no doubt. Maybe a knight, maybe a mere man at arms like me." You realise that you can make out the shape of horse bones half-buried in the sand.</p>
<p>He continues: "I know that you have been following me. Well, no wonder. You must realise that one of us is involved in these dissapearances, just as I have."</p>
<p>"We are all on edge, and none of us are without secrets."</p>
<p>To your surprise, Martense laughs. "I am! I am no more than I claimed to be the first time we spoke, a mercenary in search of work, though I am beginning to regret not seeking for an easier job back in Crescentium."</p>
<p>He grows serious. "Well, let me tell you who I suspect. Donna Viltry. You will think me mad, but I believe that she is involved in some criminal enterprise and these vanishings are related."</p>

<p>A terrified teamster falls to his knees, calling on the Illuminate to save them, while another makes the sign of the True Faith and mumbles a prayer. You can see why — the priest's body has been mutilated, his heart has been torn from his chest, leaving his body covered in blood.</p>
<p>Mistress Farah lets out a wail. "Now it is murder!" She rounds on the gathered travellers. "Never has this happened. The sacred oath of the caravan has been violated. One amongst you is a monster, to have done this. Will no one speak out? Will no one name the killer so that we may have our vengeance?"</p>

<p>"The killer is Donna Viltry."</p>
<p>Donna Viltry cries out: "Mardre di Dio! How dare you!" She continues to curse you, but the crowd drown her out.</p>
<p>You outline your case, telling the crowd how Donna Viltry is near bankruptcy, having sold off her family heritage to finance one last desperate expedition. The missing people, poor Iskander included, were agents of her creditors, and she did away with them in typical Ferromaine fashion.</p>
<p>Your case sounds thin, even to you, but it appears that the crowd is convinced. They drag Viltry before Farah, who must act as judge.</p>
<p>"Donna Viltry," she says, "you have broken the laws of the caravan, and of the Lord, by turning against your fellow travellers. This puts me in a strange position, for I have myself undertaken to carry your cargo to Sadar. If I allowed the crowd to hang you, as you deserve, I could be accused of killing you to steal your goods. So, it is my decision that you shall be put into the desert with only the clothes on your back, to make your own way to the city. If God has mercy on you, you may collect your cargo there."</p>

<p>"The killer is Sir Boise."</p>
<p>You see Boise in the crowd, but the knight says nothing.</p>
<p>You outline your case, telling the crowd how Sir Boise was at the dinner where Usquail served, how he was missing during the battle when Rida and Kashif vanished, how he is not even a true knight but has stolen the clothing of a dead man left in the desert.</p>
<p>You go out even further on a limb: "He is not even human, but some sort of beast in disguise. It may sound fantastic, but by the Prophet and the Illuminate, I swear that it is true!"</p>
<p>Your case sounds thin, even to you, but it appears that the crowd is convinced. They close on Sir Boise to take him captive, but before they can, a terrible transformation overtakes him. His human face vanishes like a mirage in the sands, replaced by the snarling visage of a lion. Tattered wings unfurl from his back like sails, and his hands transform into the claws of a lion. Boise is revealed as a Pazuzu of terrible power, the Winged King of the Desert, whose minions have chased you all the way from Crescentium.</p>
<p>The caravaneers fall back in dismay as the King strides towards you, claws out.</p>
<p>"Cur, you have ruined my disguise. I am done toying with you, it is time for to hand over the Icon, and die."</p>
<p>You must <span class='check'>&nbsp;fight&nbsp;</span> the Winged King, but you have the assistance of the caravaneers, who rally to your side.

The only settlement in reach, Rocapel, is already in enemy hands. So, when the stars have risen, you leave your shelter and head north, making for the pilgrim road and the hills beyond. The desert night is quite the opposite of the day, a chill silence, disturbed only by the scuttling of scorpions and the furtive passage of foxes. You pull your clothing tight around you and shiver your way north.</p>
<p>It takes all night, but as the sun rises, you see a line of cliffs, crowned with what looks like a singular tower, balanced on the edge.</p>
<p>With no other destination in sight, you head for the tower, only to discover a caravan from Crescentium encamped at the base of the cliffs.

The remains of a camp show where the riders spent the night; they have left behind ash piles, a latrine pit, and a mess of scraps and litter that make you doubt that they are a military unit.</p>
<p>Searching the hollow, you discover a small trickle of water emerging from the back wall, enough for you to refill an empty <b>waterskin</b> if you have one.

                        <p>You set out beside Sir Boise, who rides a powerful roan stallion, following the road east from the oasis. The wasteland of the open desert gives way to scattered scrub, then trees, and finally the olive groves and orangeries of Sadar itself. By early evening, you have reached the river valley and the walls of Sadar, which sits on the eastern shore. Sadar is a small walled city, with high copper rooftops glittering above whitewashed walls. A broad stone bridge arches from it, crossing the river towards Ibrahim. Normally the city is surrounded by dusty fields and orange groves, instead, you ride past the tented ranks of Prince Adymas's army. On the other side of the river, you can just make out the Caliph's matching bivouac.</p>
<p>The city gate is well guarded, but with Boise at your side, you pass through without issue. Inside, the narrow streets are packed with soldiers and refugees from the fighting across the river. Badawins and crusaders rub shoulders under the striped awnings that spread from building to building.</p>
<p>You ask where Prince Adymas is to be found, and are directed towards a large building crowned with a singular tower overlooking the river, from which, you are told, the Prince plans his strategies. You expect Boise to leave you now, but he takes the same road.</p>
<p>"Hold hard," you say to him, reining Bayard in, "what is <i>your</i> business with the Prince?"</p>
<p>Boise gives you a curious look, then says, "I'll tell you truthfully then. I am a messenger, sent to the Prince by Marshall Vallin with an item of the utmost importance, and unless I miss my mark, you are on the same mission."</p>
<p>You laugh. "How like Coros Vallin to be so cunning! Who knows how many messengers he sent, and which of us has the real package. Let us go up and see."</p>
<p>You continue to the palace, where a grim-faced sentry asks for proof of your mission. If you have the <b>letter of identity</b> Coros Vallin gave you, <a href='#241'>turn to 241</a>, otherwise <a href='#148'>turn to 148</a>.</p>

There are covered wagons and bleating strings of camels grazing by the water.</p>
<p>You ride down to the lake's edge and plunge your hands and face into the water, relishing the delicious cold. Bayard puts his nose in the water right beside you and drinks eagerly, then tosses his head, drenching you with spray.</p>
<p>"Ah! A stranger!"</p>
<p>You rise and find yourself greeted by a Capellar knight, a big man with a shaggy mane of brown hair crammed under a loose hood. He offers you his hand and introduces himself as Sir Boise of Lantry.</p>
<p>"Are you bound for Sadar?"</p>
<p>You confirm that you are, and Boise tells you that he has urgent business in the city. "I've been travelling with this caravan, but they seem determined to linger and do business with the Badawin, and I cannot wait. I was hoping to find someone to ride with, and now it seems that providence has sent me to you. Will you join me?"</p>
<p>This indeed seems like providence, so you agree. Boise gives you time to refill your <b>waterskins</b>, and then <a href='#202'>joins you on the road to Sadar (turn to 202)</a>.</p>

<p>You emerge from the cover of the rocks, surprising Iskander, who you can now see was bowing to a trio of graven images made from whales teeth.</p>
<p>"You are no priest!" you accuse.</p>
<p>Iskander is taken aback, but musters a reply. "That I am, but not a priest of your Gods. I am from Mercania, and it is the gods of the old faith that I acknowledge, Twu, and Loge, and Hella. There is no crime in that, but in this land it is easier simply to call myself a priest and not say of who. My faith is no weaker for that!"</p>
<p>He rises, and the desert dust whips up around him as if stoked by his anger. "Do not presume to judge me. Do we not all have our secrets?"</p>
<p>You cannot deny his words and are moved to offer him an apology, of sorts. "I am sorry, but you asked me to watch my companions like a hawk, and you are not exempt from that."</p>
<p>The wind subsides and Iskander laughs. "I did that, but you have wasted a day watching me when your eyes might have been better on others."</p>
<p>You decide to keep your own counsel on that, and <a href='#118'>return to the caravan (turn to 118)</a> (marking a box).</p>

                        <p>You are shown into the tower-top chamber where Prince Adymas has set up his base of operations. Mounds of maps and charts, books and astrolabes, litter every available surface. On a heavy desk, a plan of the Sadar crossing has been set up in miniature, complete with wooden tokens for military units. A rumpled camp bed in the corner makes it clear that the Prince spends most of his time in this high place, where broad windows look down over the bridge, river, and city.</p>
<p>The Prince himself looks harried but glad to see you. He rises from his seat as you enter, still favouring the leg he injured at the battle of Dracon six months ago.</p>
<p>"If you are the messengers Marshall Vallin has promised me, then you are well met."</p>
<p>You bow deeply to the Prince. "I am, my Lord."</p>
<p>You produce the <b>mysterious package</b> and offer it to the Prince, expecting Sir Boise to do the same, but at that moment a terrible transformation overtakes the knight. His skin withers to a burnt brown, his hands and features are transformed into those of a powerful but cadaverous lion, and tattered eagle's wings burst from his shoulders. This is the Winged King of the Desert, a Pazuzu of terrible power.</p>
<p>The best leaps forward and slashes out with its claws, inflicting a terrible ragged wound on the Prince's side.</p>
<p>"Give me the icon!" the Pazuzu roars. "I will not be enslaved again!"</p>
<p>Adymas tumbles to the ground on the far side of the desk, and you realise that he managed to snatch the package from your hands as he fell, and is even now struggling to extract the <b>golden icon</b> from within.</p>
<p>"Keep ... him busy!" Adymas gasps, "I will ... the ritual ..."</p>
<p>The King roars and flings the heavy desk aside, but you move to block him grimly drawing your weapons. You must <span class='check'>&nbsp;fight&nbsp;</span> him.</p>

The light does not affect you, but it wraps around the King like a coil of rope, rendering him powerless. He roars in anguish and frustration but falls slowly to his knees before the Prince, who advances unsteadily, holding the icon in one hand and pressing the other to the bloody wound in his side.</p>
<p>"Pazuzu," the Prince gasps, "by the power of the Pantocrator, whose servants we all are, and the spells upon this icon, you must do as I say."</p>
<p>The King howls. "Have I not suffered enough at the hands of the Caliph? Have I not turned my soldiers into mercenaries? Must I be enslaved further, and swap one master for another?"</p>
<p>Prince Adymar crosses himself fervently. "As the Lord God is my witness, you will not. I have no desire to add demons to my army. This is my command, that you and all your creatures depart this place and never again disturb the people of Outremar so long as I live."</p>
<p>The Pazuzu struggles against the magical bonds that link him to the icon, but he cannot resist. Finally, he lowers his head: "I hear, oh master, and obey."</p>
<p>The red light fades as the Prince slumps against an overturned table. The King breaks free of the bonds, but instead of attacking, leaps to crouch in the window. He fixes his burning eyes on you and growls, "You had better hope you <i>don't</i> outlive your master!"</p>

<p>"Any one of us could be responsible, of course, but I know it is neither of us. We were still drinking when the man vanished. By the same token, Martense must also be innocent. I think we should work together to try and uncover the one responsible before something worse can happen. You should keep an eye on the others, watch out for anything untoward."</p>

                        <p>In the days following the Winged King's defeat, Prince Adymar calls for you to attend him at his bedside, where he is recuperating from the wound that the Pazuzu dealt him. He waves away the guards, ensuring that you are alone.</p>
<p>"I am sure you are too polite, and too wise in the ways of the world, to ask questions, but I feel that I owe you an explanation for why your life was put in such deadly danger."</p>
<p>You protest, but he raises a hand for silence. "No, no. My mind is made up."</p>
<p>Propped up on his divan pillows, the Prince explains how his forces had come under attack from 'winged devils', and assassins disguised as soldiers, lepers, and badawin. Fearing that this was a ploy by the Caliph, he asked Coros Vallin to investigate.</p>
<p>"Vallin was able to discover that a Zhenir magician named Sufian had laid his hands on the golden icon, which in ancient days had been enchanted to command the services of the creature named Pazuzu, the Winged King. Sufian employed the icon to force the King and his minions to attack me, but Sufian was hungry for power. He tried to those very forces to usurp the Caliph's throne.</p>
<p>"Well, the attempt went wrong. Sufian fled Zhenir, but he perished when pirates overtook his ship. Dear Coros was able to obtain the icon, and sent it here to me, imagining — I think — that I would use it to launch my own attack on the Caliph. And, of course, all the time the Pazuzu themselves were searching high and low for the accursed thing. Vallin did not dare send it openly, which is where you came in.</p>
<p>The Prince takes your hand. "It was a hard road we sent you on, but Coros picked made the right choice. Without you, we would have been lost, and you have my gratitude for it."</p>
<p>"Now, bring me that box there."</p>
<p>You bring the box that the Prince indicated, a long light container of carved sandalwood, and lay it on the side of the bed. The Prince lifts the lid, and you see an array of marvellous magical items laid out on a bed of velvet.</p>
<p>"Please, take any one of these, with my gratitude," the Prince exclaims.</p>
<p>The items inside the chest consist of:
<ul><li>An inlaid <b>silver scimitar +1</b> (d8+1,5)</li>
<li>A <b>carnelian amulet</b> that stores 4 Magic Points (you can refresh them from your own magic points at any time)</li>
<li>A gossamer <b>cloak of stealth</b> that gives +4 Stealth while in natural settings</li>

<p>The djinn rubs his hands on his silk-clad belly and launches into his tale.</p>
<p>"Here is the truth of it. As I said, the Queen, may the Illuminate bless her, is our sole ruler, but it was not always so. Once, as is the way of things, our Queen had a King. His name was Pazuzu.</p>
<p>"Pazuzu was a mighty king, but he was filled with pride. He felt himself to be the equal of the Creator, and proclaimed himself the king not only of our people, but of the whole desert, from edge to distant edge of it. From this kingdom he raised an army to challenge heaven. It was a mighty thing, I remember it well. The thunder of our passing shook the world itself!"</p>
<p>Abu Wasr looks as if he might shed a tear, but instead, he continues: "But, of course, the might of the king was nothing before the might of God. With a single word, the lord humbled King Pazuzu. He took from him his beauty, his power, his people, and cast him out into the desert he had claimed for himself, a twisted and diminished thing. Dangerous to mortals like yourself, to be sure, but nothing as he was."</p>
<p>"But," you interject, "I have heard of these pazuzu as a race of creatures. Are all these stories of him?"</p>
<p>Abu Wasr shakes his mighty head. "Oh no. The curse of the king's blood runs deep, and he has made lesser children for himself, a rag-tag echo of the army he once commanded. It is a sad thing, but must be as the Creator wills it."</p>

<p>You accept the invitation to join the rather incongruous grouping of Sir Boise, Donna Viltry, and Mehmet, who have gathered under the awning of Viltry's billowing tent. A caravaneer named Usquail hurries back and forth, serving choice morsels from Viltry's cargo. When you take your seat, you are presented with spiced lamb, soft pitas, and minted tea. If this is a sample of the food that Viltry is bringing to Prince Adymas, you can see why his Highness might be tempted to buy!</p>
<p>Boise and Viltry seem engrossed in a conversation about the road ahead, and the conditions they will find in Sadar. It is quickly clear to you that Mehmet and yourself have been invited so that you can be pumped for information — Mehmet as an expert on the road ahead, and you as a source of intelligence on the temperament of the Prince.</p>
<p>"I am no expert on the Prince," you protest, "I am merely a traveller."</p>
<p>"Don't take us for fools," Viltry replies. "I have contacts at the Temple of the Roc, and I know you met with Marshall Coros Vallin. You are more than you seem! If you know the Prince's plans you <i>must</i> tell me!"</p>
<p>Sir Boise reacts to this with a start, and you feel his eyes on you, though you cannot interpret his expression.</p>

You expect to follow the road, but Balthazar immediately turns right, heading onto the coastal plain.</p>

<p>You remove the <b>golden icon</b> from its box and hold it up. At once, a clear golden light spills out from the icon. As the light falls on the ancient rock paintings they appear to come to life. The winged figures, which had been gathered around the painted icon in positions of hostility, come to the ground and bend down in obedience. When the last of them, who appears to wear some sort of crown, has bent the knee, the light from the icon fades, and the painting becomes still once more.</p>

                        <p>Night falls across the city like a blanket of silk laid across the shoulders of a slumbering lover. From the high vantage point of Coros Vallin's hall, you see the lights of the city spread out like stars — the glowing lamps hung in the windows of the temples, the flickering candle flames of the low warrens, and the bright steady beacon of the lighthouse rising at the far end of the bay, which lays a path across the sea that is echoed by the distant moon.</p>
<p>In the other direction, the direction you must travel tomorrow, there is nothing but the darkness of the open desert. This has been a day of signs and portents, you cannot help but fear what may come next, and it is with such uneasy thoughts in your mind that you fall into a restless slumber.</p>
<div class='rules'>If you have lost any Health, you may regain 1 Health Point now.</div>
<p>In the morning, you wake early, and share a quick pre-dawn meal of sesame bread and mint tea with Coros' men, then fetch Bayard from the stable. As you pass through the courtyard gates you glance back and see the shadow of the old man watching you from behind the windows of his sanctum.</p>
<p>Outside, the city is waking up. The muezzins are calling the Ta'ashim to morning prayer, and the beggars are taking up their stations. It is time to choose your course.

                        <p>"I'm innocent!" you shout, gripping the wooden bars set into the door of your makeshift prison.</p>
<p>"Save it for Mistress Farah," Owais chuckles, "or for the noose!"</p>
<p>The interior of the hut is a single room with stone walls and a flat roof. The door is flimsy enough, you could probably bash it open, but a quick peek through the bars shows you that one of the caravan guards has been stationed outside. At least it's cool in here. You slump down on the beaten earth of the floor to consider your fate. Someone killed Iskander, who? He was at the back of Boise's tent. Was it Boise? or is that too obvious?</p>
<p>The day slides past. You watch the barred sunlight edge across the floor from right to left. You begin to feel hungry, and thirsty, but no one comes to bring you food, and eventually, you start to doze.</p>
<p>You are woken by the sound of the door being unbarred. The glare of the sun tells you that it's late afternoon. You scramble to your feet and see Mistress Farah at the door, and tell her the same thing you told the guards and Sir Boise: "I'm innocent!"</p>
<p>"I know," Farah says. "We examined the body and found that his heart had been torn from his chest!" She shivers despite the heat of the oasis sun. "No one could claim you'd comitted the crime after that, not even Owais, though he took some convincing that he'd not caught a murderer red-handed."</p>
<p>She stands aside to let you out of the hut and hands over your belongings. You see that all of the other travellers, and plenty of the caravaneers, have come to see you released.</p>
<p>"It's clear that there's a true monster amongst us," Farah says. She rounds on the assembled travellers. "As the Illuminate is my witness, one of you is a killer. Will no one expose this murderer in our midst so that we may have our vengeance?"</p>

<p>Seeing you arrive, Mistress Farah steps down from the back of her wagon and raises a hand in greeting.</p>
<p>"So, the wanderer returns. It is as it is written, what the creator joins together, man shall not split apart. It is fate that you join us, I think. We are resting on day before we make the final leg to Sadar, you will join us?"</p>

<p>A little after noon you reach a place where the trunks of dead trees poke up from the drifting sand like the bleached ribs of giants. Their wood is ash grey and riddled with tiny holes bored by beetles so that they are as fragile as the sand that surrounds them.</p>
<p>You might be able to <a href='#26'>find some food (turn to 26)</a> amongst the dead trees, but it might be better just to <a href='#230'>ride on (turn to 230)</a>.</p>

                        <p>It is morning in the oasis of El Uraj. The sun blazes in the cloudless sky, but the trees provide blessed shade, and the sparkling water cools the air. The caravan has set its camp along the western shore, with the black tents of the Badawin to the north, and a small scatter of sun-bleached buildings in between, shelters for lone travellers braving the wasteland.</p>
<p>You rise refreshed, realising that the long crossing of the valley of Cabbron is behind you. Sadar is only a day and a half to the east, though you understand that the caravan is going nowhere today.</p>
<p>You are surprised when Iskander drags you aside, looking each way to make sure he is not overheard.</p>
<p>"I know who the killer is!" he says, almost breathless with excitement.</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>He shakes his head, running a sun-browned hand through his pale hair. "No, no, I must be sure before I make an accusation, but you can help me. I visited the Badawin last night, and they have a seer there, a wise woman. She told me something that makes the whole mystery plain. I only need to do one thing to confirm what I suspect.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, you should visit the seer. Make up your own mind. I'll meet you back here soon, and we can reveal this monster to everyone."</p>
<p>Iskander hurries away towards the main camp. You can do as he suggests and <a href='#10'>visit the seer (turn to 10)</a>, <a href='#272'>follow him instead (turn to 272)</a>, or simply <a href='#304'>wait and see what happens (turn to 304)</a></p>

                        <p>You guide Bayard south, toiling like an ant across the rocky uplands until you eventually come to an area of broken ground, where boulders rest in precarious heaps as if scattered from a giant's hand. There are shadows here, and a restless wind, which kicks up dust from between the rocks.</p>
<p>The sun has not yet set, but you can go no further. You dismount in the shadows and unsaddle Bayard so that he can recover. If you wish to share some water with him, empty a filled <b>waterskin</b>.</p>
<p>You sit down with your back against one of the rocks, hoping to get some rest, perhaps to move on when it gets cooler, when a furtive seeming movement catches your eye in the nearby shadows. As you watch with growing alarm, an ash-grey skeleton digs itself out of the loose soil, hauling itself out into the light.</p>
<p>You jump to your feet and grab your weapons, just in time to see a second undead stumble out into the light. You must <span class='check'>&nbsp;fight&nbsp;</span> these creatures (both at once), or leap on Bayard's back and <a href='#293'>ride off before they reach you (turn to 293)</a>.</p>

<p>Martense leaps forward past your guard, striking a glancing blow to your arm. You prepare to fight on, but feel the trickle of blood at your elbow. A moment later it stains your wrist red, and Martense puts up his mace.</p>
<p>"First blood to me, you are defeated, and as God is my witness, so you must know that I am innocent. I will forgive you this one mistake. This blasted place makes everyman's blood run too hot. But let this be the end of it. Turn your suspicions elsewhere."</p>
<p>Martense leaps back into his saddle and rides away, leaving you to return to the caravan alone. <a href='#118'>Turn to 118</a> (marking a box).</p>

<p>"I almost pity you," Balthazar pants, "you had no idea what you were carrying, and now you've paid the price for your Prince's arrogance." He clutches the package to his chest like a talisman and leaves your remains where they fall.</p>

                        <p>Iskander asked you to stay behind as he went to confirm his suspicions, but you fear that the Mercanian is putting himself into awful danger. If he is right, and a monster lurks in the caravan, it could strike at any time.</p>
<p>Iskander weaves his way amongst the gathered tents caravan tents. He's in a hurry but cautious, forcing you to hang back or be spotted. With one last glance around himself, he vanishes behind Boise's grand white tent. You go to follow but are forced to wait a moment, as two caravaneers walk by, locked in some sort of argument.</p>
<p>Behind Boise's tent is a little isolated space, where the backs of two other tents are lashed to the trunk of a date palm tree. A sense of impending disaster comes over you as you approach. Iskander is waiting for you, back turned, bent over on his knees as if praying. You know at once that he is dead, but you run to his side anyway, wrapping your arms around him and hauling him upright.</p>
<p>The poor man is covered in blood. His chest appears to have been ripped apart.</p>
<p>You look around, intending to call for help, and are surprised by the sudden arrival of four caravan guards, led by Owais. Before you can think of explaining, they have seized you and dragged you away from Iskander's body.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" you demand, but your question is met by a sharp cuff to the face from Owais.</p>
<p>"Silence, murderer!"</p>

                        <p>You outline your case, such as it is, but you have little evidence to offer, and your arguments sound weak, even to you.</p>
<p>It seems the crowd agrees. They jeer and heckle you into silence, then surround you, grabbing your arms and relieving you of your weapons. You struggle but are dragged before Farah, who must act as judge.</p>
<p>She shakes her head at you. "Did you not swear the caravan oath, as we all did? You have called the honour of a fellow traveller into doubt, but do not have the evidence to prove your slander. I know I asked for the murderer to be uncovered, but this is not the way."</p>
<p>She sighs heavily. "I have no choice, I am bound by our laws. I must put you into the desert to make your way alone. It is not far, perhaps the Lord will have mercy on you."</p>
<p>The crowd lead you to Bayard and put you in the saddle. They return your weapons, but anything you had in Bayard's inventory is left on the ground (remove those items from your inventory) as you are jostled and jeered out of the camp and onto the desolate eastern road.</p>

                        <p>"It would be foolish to form a rearguard with only two people," you tell Boise, "no matter how doubty. If the raiders came upon us in strength we'd never prevail, and if one of us needed to take a warning back to the caravan, the other would be left alone."</p>
<p>You call out to Martense to join you, and he brings one of the caravan guards as a final scout. Sir Boise takes this development with ill grace. You have the impression that he'd have rather taken you out alone, but the rearguard is now set.</p>
<p>Martense, no doubt, is an old hand at such business. He ensures your two pairs of riders are split so that one can see the other, yet still be close enough to the caravan to carry a warning. He arranges things so that he rides with you, and the caravaneer with Boise.</p>
<p>"I wanted to ask you. I was in the thick of the fighting, it was chaos, but I did not see Boise, not until after, when the fighting was done."</p>
<p>You consider. "There was fighting all about, he might simply have been in a different place."</p>
<p>Martense allows: "He might."</p>
<p>After that, he rides on in silence, and you see no sign of the bandits, returning to the caravan as <a href='#226'>dusk begins to fall (turn to 226)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You dismount Bayard and make a circuit of the ruin on foot, exploring space between the tower and the surrounding walls. There is little to see until you come to the back of the tower, furthest from the entrance, only to be greeted by an unwelcome surprise. A body lies face down in the sand against the ruined wall at the back of the tower. The burnt and desiccated skin makes it clear that it has lain in the sun for at least a week.</p>
<p>You cautiously turn the body over — and jerk back in horror as you realise that the man's heart has been torn from his chest. When you recover your choler you take a second look at the body. It is a young northern man, but you do not recognise his face. He has been stripped of most of his possessions but is dressed in the sort of padded jack worn by knights and soldiers, though given his apparent youth, he must have been a squire or a new recruit.</p>
<p>You puzzle over how this body came to be hidden here, but the dead man has no answers, save one — embroidered on the right shoulder of his jack is a symbol like three ships surrounded by a circle. You don't recognise it, but assume it is the coat of arms of the knight he served or the unit he was a member of.</p>

<p>He rubs his oily hands together as he speaks, clearly warming up to sell you some of his treasures, but in truth, most of what he has heaped on the striped cloths of his tables appears to be rather fanciful looking trash.</p>
<p>Two items catch your eye, a <b>jewelled scarab</b>, and a <b>figured bronze shield</b>. He is asking 100 florins for the scarab, and 120 for the shield.</p>

<p>Over the following century, Estabulo's Library has become the haunt of sorcerers and warlocks, more interested in magical treasures looted during the constant wars of occupation, than the records of Estabulo's victories.

Amongst the rocks, you find strange marks, daubed on the rocks by ancient and unknown people.

<p>You are distracted from your investigations by the sound of something moving through the rocks.

<p>You dismount Bayard and approach the wreck. You spy a chest in the keel of the boat, its lid encrusted with sand and salt. "How did this come to be here," you ask yourself.</p>

You've hardly gone twenty yards, however, before you hear the clatter of hooves, and Iskander canters up to your side on the back of Martense's horse.</p>
<p>"I thought I'd come and help," he pants, no natural rider. Then, as he draws up beside you, whispers, "It's foolish to be alone with anyone now."</p>
<p>In a louder voice, Iskander says, "I may not be a warrior, Sir Boise, but in my younger days, in the fjords, I was accounted very keen of eye."</p>
<p>Iskander continues to prattle on in this fashion for the rest of your scouting trip. It is poor military discipline, but you see no sign of the bandits in any case, returning to the caravan as <a href='#226'>dusk begins to fall (turn to 226)</a>.</p>

<p>You push aside the tent flap and duck inside into the gloom. A woman is seated on a large cushion, her face hidden behind a veil of brightly coloured beads, hiding her features entirely.</p>

<p>You have the impression that the woman smiles behind her veil, but you cannot be sure. "I always speak the truth."</p>
<p>"Tell me then."</p>
<p>The seer places a cup between you and pours liquid into it from a stoppered flask. "They say there is a creature that wanders the desert and preys on those that travel it, a devil that they call Pazuzu. This demon has the shape of a man with the head and paws of a lion, and the wings of an eagle."</p>
<p>A chill passes through you at this description.</p>
<p>"It is also said that the Pazuzu can disguise itself as a man, waiting to catch its victims alone before it plucks them up into the sky, never to be seen again. But even in this form there are certain signs that give it away. No matter what shape it takes, you may know it by its cruelty, its arrogance, and the fact that it will not touch any true relic, for these it cannot abide."</p>
<p>The veiled woman leans forward and adds: "They <i>also</i> say that this creature is a King to legion of fanatical followers, and that he who can command the King could command them all ... though who can say how this could be done."</p>
<p>You realise that Iskander must mean to try and force whoever he suspects to hold a relic. You also realize that he must be putting himself in terrible danger ... <a href='#184'>turn to 184</a>.</p>

<p>The knight is fully armed, wearing both mail and helm, but when he sees you approach he raises his visor and bids you greeting. To your surprise, he seems more friendly than he ever was back in Crescentium, there is almost the hint of a smile beneath his bushy yellow moustache.</p>
<p>"Master Martense thought he saw people ahead on the road, so we rode out to intercept them, should they prove to be hostile."</p>
<p>"I'll join you."</p>
<p>Martense draws a flanged mace from his belt and spurs his horse to the front, standing up in his stirrups to survey the road. When he speaks, his voice is oddly hoarse, as if he has suffered an injury to his throat. "I could swear I had seen a party on the road, but there is nothing now."</p>
<p>Sir Boise seems nonchalant. "A mirage, perhaps. They happen. Maybe we should turn back."</p>
<p>"I would rather keep lookout."</p>
<p>"Please yourself." To your surprise, Boise wheels his roan around and rides back to the caravan, leaving you alone with Martense.</p>
<p>Martense rests his mace on his shoulder and falls back to ride beside you. "A strange one that. Will you keep watch with me?"</p>

<p>"No no! I have not done these things! Yes, I am angry at this woman, because she has sold the gift I gave to her Great Grandmother as a token of our friendship, but all I do is give her a fright and hide her small clothes. All these other things, I do not do!"</p>
<p>The boy turns to Donna Viltry and givers her a slightly insolent bow. "Signora, I am sorry. These things, they are simply bad luck.

                        <p>You have captured the leader of the raiders, a wild-eyed man with a cruel hooked beak of a beard. When you pull the keffiyeh from his head you see that his face is marked with crude tattoos to make him resemble a lion.</p>
<p>"Tell me what you were doing here," you growl.</p>
<p>"I shall tell you nothing! You do not understand what you are dealing with. When the King catches up with you, your miserable life will be as agony to you! But, my place in paradise is assured!"</p>
<p>You demand to know what King he speaks of, but before he can answer, you are joined by Sir Boise.</p>
<p>"A cur such as this should not be allowed to live." Boise says.</p>
<p>You make to object, but the leader, briefly unattended, suddenly jerks, and foam appears at his lips. Too late you realise that he has consumed poison, and there is no saving him. You search his body for further clues, but find nothing but a <b>shortsword (1d8, 3)</b>, a full <b>waterskin</b>, a small <b>shield</b>, and a pouch containing Zhenir gold worth <b>100 florins</b>.</p>
<p>"Justice is done, it seems." Boise snorts. </p>

<p>"The killer is Mehmet, the so-called pilgrim."</p>
<p>Mehmet throws up his hands to protest, but the crowd presses him into silence.</p>
<p>You outline your case against Mehmet, telling the crowd how he was at the dinner served by Usquail on the first night out of Crescentium, how he posed as an innocent pilgrim while secretly serving the Caliph as a spy, and how — no doubt — he silenced those amongst the caravaneers who were opposed to his schemes.</p>
<p>Your case sounds thin, even to you, but it appears that the crowd is convinced. They rush forward to grab Mehmet, relieving him of his belt dagger and a second blade that he has concealed up his sleeve, then drag him before Farah, who must act as judge.</p>
<p>"Mehmet the pilgrim," she says, "you have broken the laws of the caravan, and of the Lord, by turning against your fellow travellers. If I were a noble, I would have you hung, but instead you shall be put into the desert with only the clothes on your back, and may God have mercy on you!"</p>

<p>"Beware!" The sorcerer exclaims before you can speak. "For I am a potent master of the mystical arts, and will not suffer anyone to interfere in my research!"</p>
<p>You assure the hooded figure that you have no desire to interfere with anything, but only to seek aid for a journey you are soon to make — you do not mention the destination, just as neither of you supplies a name.</p>
<p>The sorcerer lays down the wand and produces a stoppered vial from a fold of their robe. "If you are yourself gifted in the magical arts, this potion might aid you, if you are willing to pay the price. But if you have no such knowledge, I have nothing for you!"</p>

<p>By the time you reach the spot, a crowd of caravaneers has gathered. You push your way through and see a body lying on its back in a pool of blood. It is Iskander, and the poor priest has been horribly mutilated. When you pull back the folds of his robe you find that his heart has been torn from his body!</p>
<p>"Aiee, we are undone!" Mistress Farah throws up her hands as she sees what has happened to Iskander. "Never before has this happened to me, a member of the caravan murdered, the sacred oath violated!"</p>

<p>Taking coffee here costs <b>1 florin</b>. When it arrives, you are surprised to find it fortified with spirits.</p>
<p>"The Ta'ashim teaches that alchohol is one of the many sins that man must avoid," Iskander tells you. "Luckily, you and I are of the north, and thus may take somewhat greater liberties. I have been here some days awaiting the departure of the caravan, and the servants are aware of my tastes, I hope it meets your expectations!"</p>
<p>"Have you made the acquaintance of any of the other travellers?" you ask.</p>
<p>"A little. Sir Boise you have met already, if you can call that a meeting, and Mehemt of course. A Ta'ashim infidel, sadly, but otherwise a good man.

<p>"I sense that you are in need of the saviour's blessing," he says. "It is taught that gold can buy salvation. Place your offering in the bowl." You see that a copper offering bowl has been placed at the base of the pillar.</p>

<p>Balthazar snatches a knife from his belt, his eyes are wild. "Fool! Don't you understand what you <i>carry</i>? The Winged King has sent all his servants to find it, but I'm the one, and now <i>I</i> can force the King to my will!"</p>
<p>You don't know what he's talking about, but you leap to your feet, grabbing your weapon from the ground. Balthazar makes a moan of dismay, and calls out: "Oh my King! Help me!"</p>

<p>You must fight Balthazar without your armour, but you may either <a href='#69'>strike first (turn to 69)</a>, or <a href='#254'>try and knock the package from his hand (turn to 254)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You defeat the last of the skeletons, scattering its pale bones on the sand, but you don't hang around to discover if there are more undead amongst these accursed rocks. You quickly re-saddle Bayard and <a href='#73'>ride east (turn to 73)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You think better of trying to enter the mysterious city; some things are best left beyond the ken of mortal man. You hurridly mount Bayard once more and ride south. When you glance back over your shoulder, the city is gone.</p>
<div class='rules'>Make a tracking check. If you have the tracking skill, roll under your PERCEPTION on 1d20. Otherwise, make the same check using half your PERCEPTION, rounding down. If you have a <b>map of the principalities</b>, add 5 to your PERCEPTION. If you make the check <a href='#248'>turn to 248</a>.</div>
<p>Otherwise, night falls. You must stop to make camp in the empty wastes.</p>
<div class='rules'><p>You must eat one <b>ration</b>, (or use a spell like Abundance, Banquet, Nourish, or Stargaze to provide food), and drink water (empty a filled <b>waterskin</b>, or use Nourish, Rain, or Stargaze).</p>
<p>If you do not eat, lose one Health Point. If you do not drink, lose two Health Points (or one, if you are wearing a <b>thobe</b> or other desert clothing). If you eat <i>and</i> drink, regain 1 Health Point.</p>
<p>If these losses reduces you to zero Health Points <a href='#269'>turn to 269</a>.</p></div>

                        <p>You put your heels to Bayard's flanks and drive him to a wild gallop towards Sadar. The wasteland of the open desert gives way to scattered scrub, then trees, and finally the olive groves and orangeries of Sadar itself. The sun chases you all the way, battering you with heat. If you don't have a filled <b>waterskin</b> (or magical means of creating water), lose one Health Point (this doesn't empty the waterskin).</p>
<p>You ride on into the dusk, eventually reaching the river valley and the walls of Sadar, which sits on the eastern shore. Sadar is a small walled city, with high copper rooftops glittering above whitewashed walls. A broad stone bridge arches from it, crossing the river towards Ibrahim. Normally the city is surrounded by dusty fields and orange groves, instead, you ride past the tented ranks of Prince Adymas's army. On the other side of the river, you can just make out the Caliph's matching bivouac.</p>
<p>The city gates are still open, despite the hour, as soldiers hurry back and forth, though they are well guarded. As you slow Bayard to a walk, patting his sweat-beaded flank, a trio of halberdiers hurry up to block your way.</p>
<p>"What's your business in Sadar, stranger?"</p>
<p>If you are carrying your <b>letter of identity</b>, you can show it and <a href='#289'>head into the city (turn to 289)</a>. Otherwise, you must <a href='#242'>convince them of your need to be here (turn to 242)</a>, <a href='#90'>try to charge the gate (turn to 90)</a>, or simply hope to <a href='#70'>wait them out (turn to 70)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You go to strike the fatal blow, but the King folds his tattered wings around himself and a scorching desert wind howls into existence, pushing you and the caravaneers awat. Within the vortex, the King's body dissolves into whirling sand, but his voice still echoes out.</p>
<p>"Fool! You think you can best the Winged King of the Desert? It is not so! Your foolish Prince cannot use the icon to control me, if he is dead!"</p>
<p>The vortex howls its way into the sky and then speeds east towards Sadar.</p>
<p>Prince Adymar has but one chance, you must reach Sadar in time to stop the King from killing him. You leap into Bayard's saddle and <a href='#316'>gallop east (turn to 316)</a>.</p>

                        <p>You decide to keep your own company on the road, Coros Vallin did not employ you to make friends, but instead to reach Prince Adymas with all speed. Bayard plods steadily along amid the dust and noise of the caravan, occasionally snorting or flicking his ears, while you sit astride him, lost in your own thoughts. In this way you <a href='#52'>pass the day (turn to 52)</a>.</p>

<p>I hope you've enjoyed my first foray into the world of adventure Gamebooks for many years. Green Water, Crimson Stag is born out of my long-term love for both the gamebook format and the Dragon Warriors game — which was the first RPG I ever owned. Starting with book 5, I was drawn into a world of haunted forests, capricious fey, and ancient Gods, all the elements I have tried to bring to this book. If you liked the game, or want to get in touch for any other reason, look me up at <a href="https://<i>www.teuton.org/~stranger/">https://</i>www.teuton.org/~stranger/</a>. </p>
